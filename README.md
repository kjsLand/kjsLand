### Hey there, I'm Kevin 
Here are some projects I have made:

## [DQI-SAT solver]([https://github.com/kjsLand/DQI_SAT_Solver]) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=Python&logoColor=white&style=flat"/>
  <p>This is the capstone project I created for my master's program which explores the idea of a quantum speedup for the SAT problem. </p>

## [TheScribbler]([https://github.com/kjsLand/TheScribbler]) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/logo-javascript-blue?logo=javascript"/>
  <p>Finds a canvas on the Jackbox TKO browser and draws a given image with the colors required by the game. </p>

## [RateIt](https://github.com/kjsLand/rate_it) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=Python&logoColor=white&style=flat"/>
<p>Uses requests library and Spotify's API to help users locally store ratings for songs. The goal is to quickly create playlists and discover new artists.</p>
